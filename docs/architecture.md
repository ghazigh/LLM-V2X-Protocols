# System Architecture

## Overview

The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into 6G V2X communication protocols to enhance message efficiency and understanding.

## Modules

1. **Semantic Compression**

   - Utilizes transformer-based models to compress messages semantically.
   - Reduces bandwidth usage without losing critical information.

2. **Context-Aware Messaging**

   - Incorporates contextual data (e.g., location, time) into messages.
   - Enhances relevance and facilitates better decision-making.

3. **Multi-Language Support**

   - Leverages MarianMT models for translation.
   - Supports multiple languages to cater to international networks.
